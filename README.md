# NFT Marketplace
Advanced Blockchain Technology(CPSC 559) - Under Professor Wenlin Han at California State University-Fullerton

# Project Description:
The NFT application is a marketplace-like platform that allows users to purchase and transfer NFTs, which are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain. To facilitate this, the app uses HardHat, a development environment for Ethereum projects, to compile and deploy smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain.

The front-end of the app is built using a React app template that comes with pre-built Ethereum components and hooks. This allows for easy integration with the Ethereum network and access to important features like the ability to read and write data to the blockchain.

The application also allows buyers to mint their own NFTs, giving them the ability to create and sell their own unique digital assets on the platform.
